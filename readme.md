## Introduction
Very very very very old project. My first try on gaming industry... :)
Should compile with the SDL libraries on unix platforms.

Oh yeah, and there is no FPS limiter implemented at all so this game is probably quite fast on current generation machines. Also collision checking sucks. But maybe I'll finish this game some day!
